# TSPF Symbolic Primitives

This repository presents a public preview of the **Triangle Symbolic Processing Framework (TSPF)**: a symbolic computing model inspired by quantum behavior but implemented entirely on classical hardware.

This framework introduces symbolic primitives such as collapse, entanglement, and basis-sensitive logic to model secure, irreversible computation in environments where no-cloning and entropy convergence are critical.

Note: This repository provides high-level examples only. Core implementation logic is protected under a patent-pending license. For access to full features or partnership inquiries, contact [frank@qsymbolic.com](mailto:frank@qsymbolic.com).

## Claims

### 1. System Claims

1. A symbolic quantum simulation system, comprising:
   - a symbolic memory comprising a plurality of symbolic registers, each register configured to store a symbolic state selected from classical deterministic states, symbolic ambiguity states (∆), or phase-encoded states (θ);
   - a collapse mechanism configured to irreversibly determine the value of a symbolic register upon read access;
   - an entanglement subsystem that links multiple symbolic registers such that collapse of one register determines or constrains the collapse of its entangled counterpart;
   - a symbolic gate execution module configured to apply logical transformations on symbolic registers in accordance with a universal gate set;
   - a tamper-aware quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol simulated entirely in-memory, relying on symbolic basis matching and entanglement collapse outcomes.

2. The system of claim 1, wherein said entanglement subsystem simulates Bell pairs and GHZ states using symbolic synchronization across registers.

3. The system of claim 1, wherein said symbolic collapse mechanism simulates measurement by resolving ambiguous and phase-encoded states to classical states based on configured collapse logic.

4. The system of claim 1, wherein symbolic gate operations include Pauli, Hadamard, controlled-NOT, and rotation gates applied to symbolic state vectors.

5. The system of claim 1, wherein said memory and entanglement logic are implemented in RAM, cache, or FPGA-backed block memory.

### 2. Method Claims

6. A method for simulating quantum entanglement and key distribution in classical memory, comprising:
   - initializing a plurality of symbolic registers with randomized symbolic bases;
   - pairing selected registers as entangled symbolic pairs;
   - simulating symbolic gate operations across said registers;
   - reading a subset of said registers to induce symbolic collapse;
   - verifying QKD key material consistency based on basis agreement and collapse correlations.

7. The method of claim 6, further comprising detecting tampering by measuring entropy deviation or collapse pattern anomalies.

8. The method of claim 6, wherein symbolic states are evolved through phase-interference rules prior to collapse.

9. The method of claim 6, wherein collapse outcomes are logged to extract a secure key string derived from entangled memory.

### 3. Computer-Readable Medium (CRM) Claims

10. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the system to:
    - allocate symbolic memory registers storing states in {∆, θ, classical};
    - configure collapse-on-read logic for said registers;
    - assign entanglement links between symbolic registers;
    - simulate BB84 or related QKD protocols in memory without transmitting physical signals;
    - detect unauthorized access by tracking collapse anomalies.

11. The medium of claim 10, wherein said instructions implement symbolic gate application with fidelity scoring based on expected amplitudes.

12. The medium of claim 10, wherein the symbolic states are compressed into a sublinear storage format representing an exponential quantum space.

13. The medium of claim 10, wherein symbolic collapse simulates measurement over entangled memory pairs to extract key material or trigger tamper alerts.

## What is TSPF?

TSPF models symbolic registers with ambiguity (`∆`) and provides rules for irreversible collapse, entanglement between states, and optional phase tagging.

### Core Primitives (Public Overview)

| Primitive       | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `∆` (Ambiguity) | Register begins in an unknown state (not 0 or 1)            |
| `COL_∆`         | Collapse to 0 or 1 based on symbolic basis (e.g., X or Z)   |
| `ENT`           | Symbolic entanglement between registers                     |
| `θ` (Phase Tag) | Optional tag representing symbolic phase or lineage         |
| `SYM_NOT`       | Symbolic NOT respecting ambiguity and collapse semantics    |

## Basic Usage (Conceptual Example)

```python
from tspf.primitives import Register, collapse, entangle

# Initialize a symbolic register
r1 = Register(state='∆')

# Collapse the register using a selected basis
r1.collapse(basis='X')  # Resolves to 0 or 1 irreversibly

# Entangle with another register
r2 = Register(state='∆')
entangle(r1, r2)         # r2 will collapse in relation to r1
