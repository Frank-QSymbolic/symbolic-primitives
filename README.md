# TSPF Symbolic Primitives

This repository presents a public preview of the **Triangle Symbolic Processing Framework (TSPF)**: a symbolic computing model inspired by quantum behavior but implemented entirely on classical hardware.

This framework introduces symbolic primitives such as collapse, entanglement, and basis-sensitive logic to model secure, irreversible computation in environments where no-cloning and entropy convergence are critical.

Note: This repository provides high-level examples only. Core implementation logic is protected under a patent-pending license. For access to full features or partnership inquiries, contact [frank@qsymbolic.com](mailto:frank@qsymbolic.com).

## What is TSPF?

TSPF models symbolic registers with ambiguity (`∆`) and provides rules for irreversible collapse, entanglement between states, and optional phase tagging.

### Core Primitives (Public Overview)

| Primitive       | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `∆` (Ambiguity) | Register begins in an unknown state (not 0 or 1)            |
| `COL_∆`         | Collapse to 0 or 1 based on symbolic basis (e.g., X or Z)   |
| `ENT`           | Symbolic entanglement between registers                     |
| `θ` (Phase Tag) | Optional tag representing symbolic phase or lineage         |
| `SYM_NOT`       | Symbolic NOT respecting ambiguity and collapse semantics    |

## Basic Usage (Conceptual Example)

```python
from tspf.primitives import Register, collapse, entangle

# Initialize a symbolic register
r1 = Register(state='∆')

# Collapse the register using a selected basis
r1.collapse(basis='X')  # Resolves to 0 or 1 irreversibly

# Entangle with another register
r2 = Register(state='∆')
entangle(r1, r2)         # r2 will collapse in relation to r1
